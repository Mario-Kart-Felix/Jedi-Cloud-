Abstract
Background/Case Studies: Chronically transfused recipients with sickle cell disease, thalassemia, and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia are constantly exposed to the dangers of red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization. Correct identification of alloantibodies is vital to find a compatible donor unit for such patients. Diagnostic labs performing high-complexity testing are dependent on difficult-to-procure rare donor RBCs as a reagent in antibody identification panels. The RHAG gene encodes a clinically important protein (RhAG) responsible for bringing the immunogenic Rh blood group system proteins RhD and RhCE to the RBC surface. In this study, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology was utilized to knock out the RHAG gene in immortalized human-inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), followed by differentiation into primitive erythroblasts.
Study Design/Methods: Guide RNAs (gRNA) designed to target a region spanning exons 2 and 3 of the RHAG gene were cloned into a GFP-Cas9 expression vector and transfected into K562 erythro-leukemia cells to test their ability to mediate gene deletion. GFP-positive cells were sorted, grown for a week, genotyped and phenotyped to confirm RHAG/RhAG deletion. gRNAs found to be the most efficient at gene deletion were then cloned into a puromycin-Cas9 expression vector and transfected into a blood group O, HLA Class 1-negative iPSC founder line. Puromycin-resistant iPSC clones were picked, expanded, and genotyped to confirm the RhAG deletion. Wild-type (WT) and knock-out (RhAG KO) iPSC lines were then differentiated into hematopoietic progenitor cells and primitive erythroblasts using a specialized cocktail of RBC-promoting cytokines and growth factors. The resulting erythroblasts were evaluated by flow cytometry for a panel of RBC antigens that included RhAG, RhDCE, Kell, Duffy (ACKR1), Glycophorins A/B, transferrin receptor, and Band 3.

Results/Findings: Flow cytometry forward- and side-scatter profiles of iPSC-derived primitive erythroblasts were similar to that of mature human RBCs. Both WT and RhAG KO erythroblasts expressed Kell, Glycophorin A/B, transferrin receptor, and Band 3, but not Duffy. The results are in accordance with the genetic make-up of the iPSC line used in the study, which started out Duffy negative. Importantly, whereas WT iPSC-derived erythroblasts strongly expressed RhAG/RhDCE, those in which the RHAG gene had been knocked out were negative for both RhAG as well RhDCE.

Conclusions: Red cell precursors derived from CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited human iPSCs missing one or more blood group systems may be able to provide rare donor reagent RBCs for the production and use in antibody identification panels, currently available nationwide for the determination of pre-transfusion red cell alloimmunization
