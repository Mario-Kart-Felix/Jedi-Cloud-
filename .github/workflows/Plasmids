Target species: mouse
CRISPR/Cas9 KO Plasmids consists of Pem-specific 20 nt guide RNA sequences derived from the GeCKO (v2) library
For CRISPR gene knockout, gRNA sequences direct the Cas9 protein to induce a site-specific double strand break (DSB) in the genomic DNA
Target-specific CRISPR Plasmids for both gene knockout and activation are available. Please refer to the detailed product information in the tabs below
All products are provided as transfection-ready, purified plasmid DNA, except the Lentiviral Activation Particles which have been prepackaged as Lentiviral Particles for use with hard-to-transfect cells
